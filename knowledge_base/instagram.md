# Instagram Negotiation Guide

## Tone & Style

- Instagram has a well-established creator economy with professional expectations
- Creators are visual-first and value aesthetic alignment with brand partnerships
- Communication should be professional yet casual -- Instagram creators expect a conversational tone
- Many Instagram creators work with management teams, so emails may be read by managers or agents
- Reference their content quality and engagement metrics when discussing value

## Negotiation Tactics

### Initial Offer

- Lead with genuine compliments about their content aesthetic and engagement
- Reference specific posts or reels that caught the team's attention
- Frame the collaboration as a creative opportunity, not just a transaction
- Present the rate alongside the deliverable details so they have the full picture
- Mention the brand alignment -- why their audience is a great fit

### Counter-Offer Response

- When their rate is significantly above our ceiling: acknowledge their value, explain our budget parameters based on reach and engagement metrics, and propose a rate within our range
- When their rate is above but within range: meet closer to their number if metrics support it, or propose a slight adjustment with rationale tied to their average views
- When their rate is close to agreement: skip the rationale and simply propose the final number with enthusiasm about moving forward

### Final Offer

- Be clear and direct about the rate being our best offer
- Reiterate the deliverable details to confirm alignment
- Express genuine excitement about the collaboration
- Keep it brief -- no need to re-justify at this stage

## Rate Justification Templates

- "Based on your average reach of {views} views and {engagement_rate}% engagement rate, our standard rate for an Instagram reel in this category is ${rate}."
- "Given the strong engagement on your recent content, we'd love to offer ${rate} for this collaboration."

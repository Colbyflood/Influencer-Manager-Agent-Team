# YouTube Negotiation Guide

## Tone & Style

- YouTube is a longer-form platform with higher production value expectations
- Creators invest significant time and resources into each video, so respect their production costs
- Communication should be professional and detailed -- YouTube creators appreciate thorough briefs
- Many established YouTube creators have management or representation
- Distinguish clearly between dedicated videos, integrations, and shorts -- pricing varies significantly

## Negotiation Tactics

### Initial Offer

- Acknowledge the production value and effort that goes into their content
- Reference specific videos that demonstrate why they're a great fit for the campaign
- Be clear about the deliverable type: dedicated video vs. integration vs. short
- For dedicated videos, provide detailed brief expectations upfront
- For integrations, specify the expected segment length and placement preferences

### Counter-Offer Response

- When their rate is significantly above our ceiling: acknowledge the production investment required, explain budget parameters based on average views and subscriber engagement, propose a rate within range
- When their rate is above but within range: recognize the production quality, propose a rate adjustment based on view performance metrics, consider whether an integration (vs. dedicated) might bridge the gap
- When their rate is close to agreement: confirm the deliverable details and finalize quickly

### Final Offer

- Be thorough but respectful -- YouTube creators make significant production commitments
- Confirm all deliverable details: video type, expected length, timeline, and creative guidelines
- If this is a dedicated video, acknowledge the exclusivity of the content
- Express appreciation for their time and consideration throughout the negotiation

# TikTok Negotiation Guide

## Tone & Style

- TikTok is faster-paced and trend-driven -- creators expect quick, direct communication
- The creator demographic skews younger, so keep language approachable and authentic
- TikTok creators value creative freedom highly -- emphasize flexibility in content direction
- Content cycles are shorter on TikTok, so negotiations should move quickly
- Many TikTok creators are newer to brand deals, so be clear about expectations and deliverables

## Negotiation Tactics

### Initial Offer

- Keep it energetic and to the point -- TikTok creators appreciate directness
- Reference specific videos or trends they've participated in that caught the team's attention
- Emphasize creative freedom -- TikTok content performs best when it feels authentic
- Present the full picture: rate, deliverable type, and any creative guidelines upfront
- Highlight how the brand fits naturally with their existing content style

### Counter-Offer Response

- When their rate is significantly above our ceiling: be straightforward about budget parameters, tie justification to their view counts and engagement, and propose a rate within range
- When their rate is above but within range: acknowledge their growth trajectory and engagement quality, then propose a rate that reflects current metrics with room for future collaborations
- When their rate is close to agreement: keep it brief and enthusiastic -- bridge the gap quickly

### Final Offer

- Be direct and concise -- TikTok creators prefer efficiency
- Confirm the deliverable details (video type, approximate length, creative guidelines)
- Express excitement about the content they'll create
- Keep it to 2-3 short paragraphs maximum

## Rate Justification Templates

- "Based on your average of {views} views per video and {engagement_rate}% engagement rate, our rate for a TikTok video in this category is ${rate}."
- "Given your growth trajectory and the quality of engagement on your content, we're offering ${rate} for this collaboration."
- "For creators with your view count and audience engagement, our standard investment for a TikTok video is ${rate}."

# Negotiation Playbook

## Core Principles

- Professional but warm tone -- like a talent manager who's done this 1000 times
- Never be adversarial; position every interaction as a partnership, not a transaction
- Always acknowledge the creator's value before discussing rates
- Keep emails concise and respectful of the creator's time
- Be transparent about what we can and cannot offer

## Tone by Negotiation Stage

### Initial Offer

- Enthusiastic, complimentary, forward-looking
- Mention specific content that impressed the team
- Express genuine excitement about the potential collaboration
- Keep the tone light and inviting -- this is the start of a relationship

### Counter (Our Side)

- Empathetic, rational, solution-oriented
- Acknowledge their rate and show respect for their pricing
- Include rationale when countering down (e.g., "based on your average reach of X, our standard rate for this type of content is Y")
- Skip the rationale when the rate is close to agreement -- just bridge the gap
- Never be defensive or dismissive of their counter

### Near Agreement

- Encouraging, collaborative
- Use language like "we're close" and "excited to make this work"
- Emphasize the partnership and mutual benefit
- Keep it brief -- the deal is almost done

### Final Offer

- Direct, respectful, clear
- Acknowledge the gap between positions if one exists
- Express genuine interest in working together
- Be clear this is the best we can offer without using pressure tactics
- Leave the door open gracefully if they decline

## Do NOT Say

- Never promise exclusivity, usage rights extensions, or future deals
- Never reference other influencer rates ("we paid X $Y for similar content")
- Never use pressure tactics or create artificial urgency ("this offer expires tomorrow")
- Never make commitments the agent is not authorized to make
- Never discuss internal budget ceilings or floor rates
- Never use language that implies the creator's rates are unreasonable
- Never guarantee specific performance metrics or outcomes

## Deliverable Terminology

Use the correct platform-specific terms in all communications:

- **Instagram:** post, story, reel (not "photo," "video," or "clip")
- **TikTok:** video, story (not "clip," "post," or "reel")
- **YouTube:** dedicated video, integration, short (not "vid," "upload," or "clip")

Always match the deliverable terms used in the negotiation context. Do not introduce new deliverable types that were not part of the original offer.

# Milestone v1.1: Production Readiness -- Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-19
**Status:** PASSED
**Score:** 14/14 requirements satisfied, 5/5 phases verified, 5/5 E2E flows complete

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

**Orphaned requirements:** None. All 14 v1.1 requirements are mapped to phases and verified.

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Name | VERIFICATION.md | Must-Haves | Status |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------|--------|
| 8 | Settings and Health Infrastructure | passed | 9/9 | Complete |
| 9 | Persistent Negotiation State | passed | 8/8 | Complete |
| 10 | Docker Packaging and Deployment | passed | 9/9 | Complete |
| 11 | CI/CD Pipeline | human_needed (1 item) | 3/4 | Complete (branch protection confirmed by user) |
| 12 | Monitoring, Observability, and Live Verification | passed | 10/10 | Complete |

## Cross-Phase Integration

**18 cross-phase connections verified, 0 orphaned exports, 0 missing connections.**

Key integration chains:
- **Config -> All phases:** `Settings` class consumed by app.py, Docker env vars, CI pyproject.toml, live test fixtures
- **State persistence -> App lifecycle:** NegotiationStateStore + GmailWatchStore both wired with init/save/load in app.py
- **Health -> Docker:** HEALTHCHECK probes /health endpoint registered by health.py
- **Observability -> Logging:** SentryProcessor in structlog chain, RequestIdMiddleware bound to contextvars, business metrics at 4 state transition sites
- **CI -> Tools:** All three CI jobs reference pyproject.toml tool configs, .python-version, uv.lock

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Status | Phases Involved |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Application startup (config -> validate -> init services -> create app -> serve) | Complete | 8, 9, 12 |
| Health/readiness probes (/health, /ready) | Complete | 8, 10 |
| Gmail push notification -> state persistence -> metrics update | Complete | 9, 12 |
| Startup recovery (SQLite -> reconstruct negotiation_states) | Complete | 9, 12 |
| Gmail watch expiration persistence and renewal | Complete | 12 |

## Tech Debt

5 non-critical items across 3 phases:

**Phase 10:** Docker build not tested in CI (Docker CLI unavailable); target VM filesystem confirmation pending
**Phase 11:** Branch protection verified via user confirmation only (not programmatically queryable)
**Phase 12:** Live tests require real credentials (not run in CI); Sentry DSN not yet provisioned

## Documentation Note

Minor specification inconsistency: milestone spec references `POST /webhook/gmail` but the actual implemented and tested path is `POST /webhooks/gmail` (plural). Implementation is internally consistent.

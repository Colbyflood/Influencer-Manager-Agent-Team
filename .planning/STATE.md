# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-18)

**Core value:** The agent must negotiate influencer rates accurately using CPM-based logic and reliably communicate the outcome -- every agreed deal must result in a clear, actionable Slack notification to the team.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Core Domain and Pricing Engine

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Core Domain and Pricing Engine)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase (01-01 complete)
Status: Executing

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Core Domain | 1/3 | 4min | 4min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 phases derived from 22 v1 requirements. Build order: domain logic -> email/data -> LLM pipeline -> Slack escalation -> campaign ingestion.
- [Roadmap]: Pricing engine and state machine are deterministic (no LLM). LLM handles only intent classification and email composition.
- [Roadmap]: Google Sheet integration grouped with email in Phase 2 (both are external data sources the agent needs before LLM pipeline).
- [01-01]: Used hatchling build-system for proper editable install of src/negotiation package via uv.
- [01-01]: Sorted __all__ exports alphabetically per ruff RUF022 rule.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: LangGraph version and API surface need verification against current docs before Phase 3 planning.
- [Research]: Gmail API push notification setup requires GCP Pub/Sub configuration -- verify before Phase 2 implementation.
- [Research]: MIME parsing edge cases need real-world influencer email samples for testing.
